description: Stage 4 (Test) - automatically run build, typecheck, lint and Vitest unit tests for the app on the feature branch, set them up if missing, map results to spec requirements and write test-report.md. Use after a build/PR, when the user says "run the tests", "verify this", "is it green", or /sdlc-loop:test.

# Run the automated checks

`<pm>` is `app.packageManager` and `<app.dir>` is `app.dir` from `.claude/sdlc-loop.json`.

`<pm>` = `app.packageManager` from `.claude/sdlc-loop.json`.

Purpose: give the deployer (and the human) a single PASS/FAIL they can trust, and show which spec requirements are actually covered.

## 1. Make sure the tooling exists (install only what's missing)
Check `<app.dir>/package.json` first and add only the missing pieces, in one commit `chore: add test tooling`:
- Vitest: normally added by the builder; if missing, `<pm> --prefix <app.dir> i -D vitest` + `"test": "vitest run"`. Add `jsdom` + Testing Library only if a test renders components.
- Typecheck: `"typecheck": "tsc -b --noEmit"` if not present.
- Lint: check the TypeScript major version first (`npx tsc -v`). typescript-eslint only supports the TS versions it lists; if it doesn't support this one, don't fight peer deps - try `oxlint` (no TS dependency: `npx oxlint <app.dir>/src`) or mark lint **SKIPPED (toolchain)**.
- Installs can take minutes: run `npm i` with a long timeout or in the background. macOS has no `timeout` command.

## 2. Run all of these, even if an earlier one fails (each result goes in the report)
```
<pm> --prefix <app.dir> ci
<pm> --prefix <app.dir> run typecheck
<pm> --prefix <app.dir> run lint
<pm> --prefix <app.dir> test
<pm> --prefix <app.dir> run build
```
Also `deno check` changed files under `<app.functionsDir>` (if configured) if deno is installed; otherwise note it as skipped.

## 3. Fix loop
If something fails because of the feature code, fix it on the branch (max 3 attempts per failure), commit `<KEY>: fix tests`, push, and rerun. If it's a pre-existing failure unrelated to the change, don't fix it - record it as pre-existing.

## 4. test-report.md
```markdown
# Test report: <KEY>  -  RESULT: PASS | FAIL
Branch: <branch> @ <short sha>   Date: <ISO>
| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| typecheck | | |
| lint | | |
| unit tests | x passed / y failed | |
| build | | |
| edge functions | | |
## Spec coverage
| Req ID | Covered by | Status (pass / fail / manual - pending preview) |
## Pre-existing issues
```
RESULT is PASS only if every check passes, or its failure is pre-existing, or it is SKIPPED because the existing toolchain can't run it (say why). Update status.json (`stage: "deploy"` on PASS, stays `test` on FAIL). Return the RESULT line first.
